        <h1>Factory Farms = Pandemic Factory</h1>
        <p>
        It’s easy for those of us in the Western world to shake our heads at the
        live wildlife markets in China that appear to be the origin of the
        coronavirus pandemic now paralyzing the globe. Easy, that is, since such
        a practice is so literally quite foreign to us. (In their defense, at
        least, China has now banned such markets.)

        But what’s more difficult is to be honest with ourselves about what
        kinds of pandemics we may be brewing through own risky animal-use
        practices. And while the new coronavirus, crippling as it is, might have
        a somewhat merciful case fatality rate (proportion of those infected who
        die) of less than 1 percent, we know that this catastrophe may be just a
        dress rehearsal for an even more serious pandemic that could take a more
        gruesome toll—akin to the 1918 global flu pandemic, which originated in
        Kansas and killed at least 50 million people.

        When that day comes, it’s very likely that such a virus will also have
        its origin in humanity’s seemingly insatiable desire to eat animals,
        whether wild or domestic. The conditions in which we often farm animals
        today—crowding tens of thousands of animals wing-to-wing or
        snout-to-snout—serve as “amplifiers” for viral pandemics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, the H1N1 swine flu outbreak of 2009 appears to have originated
          in a pig confinement operation in North Carolina. And while the H5N1
          bird flu outbreak in 1997 evidently originated in Chinese chicken
          farms (case fatality rate 60 percent), a similar bird flu in the U.S.
          just five years ago led American poultry farmers to kill tens of
          millions of their birds to contain the outbreak, which thankfully
          never made the jump into the human population. And at this very
          moment, both India and China have announced bird flu outbreaks among
          their chicken factories. Similarly, these are not yet affecting human
          health.
        </p>
        <p>
        But you can only play viral Russian roulette for so long, which is why
        public health experts concerned about zoonotic diseases have for years
        been ringing the alarm about the industrial farming of animals.Michael
        Greger, author of Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching, calls factory
        farming a “perfect storm environment” for infectious diseases. “If you
        actually want to create global pandemics,” he warns, “then build
        factory farms.”

        In fact, in 2007 an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health was
        published on the topic, worrying that our mass-raising and slaughtering of
        animals for food could be the genesis of the next big global pandemic. Given the
        connection between industrial animal agriculture and pandemic risk, the American
        Public Health Association journal editorial observed: “It is curious, therefore,
        that changing the way humans treat animals—most basically, ceasing to eat them
        or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten—is
        largely off the radar as a significant preventive measure."
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2007 such a prescription might have seemed off the radar as it
        would have appeared simply too unrealistic. Today, however,
        technological progress has made it easier to imagine taking the public
        health experts’ advice more seriously.

        Yes, we humans may crave meat, but our conception of “meat” is now becoming far
        more diverse than in the past. Whereas “protein” was once synonymous with a hunk
        of flesh from a once-living animal’s body, today many Americans are embracing a
        type of protein diversity that celebrates meat from a variety of sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s the success of plant-based meat alternatives, for example,
          which are now a popular part of fast food chains’ menus across the
          country. Many forward-thinking meat companies have even released their
          own plant-based meat alternative offerings, too. Other smart meat
          companies are starting to blend plant proteins into their animal
          proteins, offering hybrid products that are better for the planet and
          public health.
        </p>
        <p>
        And then there’s the “cultivated meat” field, where start-ups, often
        backed by major meat companies, are growing real animal meat from
        animal cells rather than from animal slaughter. This kind of meat
        isn’t yet on the market, but already many people—including this
        writer—have enjoyed it, and the federal government is preparing a
        pathway to commercialization.

        Diversifying our methods of meat production would not only offer us a chance to
        reduce pandemic risk by cutting down the number of live animals we must raise
        for food, but it also could help mitigate numerous other risks as well. Whether
        the concern is climate change, antibiotic resistance, deforestation, animal
        welfare or more, the benefits of broadening our protein portfolio are manifold.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we hunker down and weather the corona storm now hitting the world,
          let us take some of our downtime to contemplate that we have the power
          to reduce the chance of the next pandemic. Yes, we should curb
          wildlife markets, but let’s not stop there. If we have the will to
          shut down our entire society for weeks on end, surely we have the will
          to slightly change our diets.

          Lance Price is a public health researcher who works at the interface between
          science and policy to address the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. In
          the laboratory, Dr. Price uses cutting-edge DNA sequencing to trace the origins
          of new antibiotic-resistant pathogens. By analyzing the genomes of bacteria
          found in humans, food, and livestock, Dr. Price and his colleagues have traced
          the origins of new superbugs to industrial livestock production. Dr. Price and
          his colleagues have also begun to broaden the scope of foodborne disease to
          include urinary tract infections caused by foodborne E. coli.
