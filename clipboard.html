        I do not regard flesh-food as necessary for us at any stage and under
        any clime in which it is possible for human beings ordinarily to live. I
        hold flesh-food to be unsuited to our species. To my mind, the life of a
        lamb is no less precious than that of a human being. I should be
        unwilling to take the life of a lamb for the sake of the human body.
