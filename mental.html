        <strong>Associations of vegetable and fruit consumption with age-related cognitive change</strong>
        by Martha Clare Morris from the Rush Institute of Health and Aging,
        Chicago, IL, published in the October 2006 issue of the journal
        Neurology found, “High vegetable but not fruit consumption may be
        associated with slower rate of cognitive decline with older age.”1 This
        six-year study of 65-year and older Chicago residents found a 35% slower
        decline in cognitive function each year for those who ate the most
        vegetables.  In the entire group of people under study the average
        number of vegetable servings a day was 2.3, with a range from 0 to 8.2.
        Green leafy vegetables, summer squash, eggplant, and kale were some of
        the vegetables found to be valuable—however, this list should not be
        considered exclusively beneficial.  The authors believe the benefits to
        the nervous system were from the antioxidants and other bioactive
        compounds (like flavanoid).  Even though fruits are also rich in these
        bioactive substances, the researchers could not explain why their
        findings failed to support similar benefits from fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
        Research from this same group published in 2004 showed, “A diet high in
        saturated or trans-unsaturated fat or low in nonhydrogenated unsaturated
        fats may be associated with cognitive decline among older persons.”2
        This dietary trend—more fat and fewer vegetables—is reminiscent of the
        discussion of heart disease, strokes, type-2 diabetes, and other
        degenerative diseases.  The same harmful diet that is causing artery
        closure to the heart may be closing the small and large arteries to the
        brain with resulting loss of intellectual activity.  Furthermore,
        research on another common form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, has
        also found a causal relationship with dietary fat and cholesterol. (See
        my June 2004 Newsletter article: Alzheimer’s Disease Can Be Safely
        Prevented and Treated Now.)
        </p>
        <p>
        Often times the variation in what people eat is so small that benefits
        are unrecognizable.  The fact that this research was done on people who
        all eat the rich Western diet and still shows a difference is
        noteworthy.  Worldwide, people’s diets show much greater variety in the
        amount of plant and animal foods. This larger variation is reflected in
        the observed difference in the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer’s
        Disease—both are much less common in Asian countries where people eat
        mostly starches (rice), compared to people of Europe and the US, where
        dairy and meat are the dominant foods
        </p>
        <p>
        The threat of becoming mentally incapacitated and a burden on family
        and society is scarier than the threat of dying.  Therefore, this
        research showing the right dietary choices will keep us functioning
        can act as a strong motivator.  The ideal diet for the preservation of
        mental and physical function is based on starches, with the addition
        of fruits and vegetables.

        <h1>Calcium Does Not Benefit Children</h1>
        <strong>Effects of calcium supplementation on bone density in healthy
        children: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials</strong>
        by Tania Winzenberg published in the October 2006 issue of the British
        Medical Journal found, “The small effect of calcium supplementation on
        bone mineral density in the upper limb is unlikely to reduce the risk of
        fracture, either in childhood or later life, to a degree of major public
        health importance.”1  The authors state, “Our results do not support the
        premise that any type of supplementation is more effective than
        another.”  Their findings mean dairy products are of no value either.
        Even studies that used intakes of 1400 mg per day of calcium showed no
        benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Osteoporosis is a real problem affecting millions of people.  The
          dairy and calcium supplement industries would like you to believe this
          potentially deadly disease is due to calcium deficiency and the
          solution is to eat lots of their products, beginning as early in life
          as possible.  They commonly point out in their sales pitches how
          important it is to intervene in childhood, so that the peak bone mass
          can be maximized early in life, preventing fractures later on in life.
          The truth is calcium deficiency is not the reason for weak bones and
          the bone mineral density (BMD) is an unreliable predictor of future
          risk for fractures.  (For more information read my October 2004
          newsletter article: Resisting the Broken Bone Businesses: Bone Mineral
          Density Tests and the Drugs That Follow.) 
        </p>
        <p>
          An accompanying editorial pointed out, “Of three qualitative reviews
          of literature published in this decade, two concluded that it is not
          known whether the modest increments in rate of bone gain after
          supplementation with calcium or dairy products will translate into
          clinically meaningful reductions in the risk of osteoporosis later in
          life or even persist beyond the treatment period. The third concluded
          that increases in dairy or total dietary calcium intake did not
          reliably increase bone mineral density or reduce fracture rate in
          children or adolescents.”2 So the research clearly contradicts the
          advertising claim of better bone health from the calcium and the dairy
          industries — and nobody is willing or able to stop these industries
          from lying to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          Osteoporosis is due to gradual loss of bone tissue (not just the
          calcium) primarily from poor nutrition and secondarily from lack of
          exercise.  Acids from the high animal protein Western diet cause the
          major damage to the bones.3  The bones provide most of the alkaline
          material to buffer this dietary-derived acid from cheese, meat,
          poultry, seafood and isolated soy protein-based foods (fake meats and
          cheeses).  The acid-base problem is compounded by the lack of alkaline
          fruits and vegetables in people’s diets.  Any positive effect that
          calcium supplements may have on bone health come from their antacid
          effects (not the calcium). For example, the popular antacid, TUMS, is
          recommended for prevention of bone loss.  TUMS is an antacid made of
          calcium and carbonates.  The alkaline carbonates neutralize dietary
          acids and stop the bone loss.  The same bone building effects from
          acid neutralizing occurs when baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) or
          potassium bicarbonates are fed to people.3  
        </p>
        <p>  
          Those who rely on calcium supplements or dairy products for stronger
          bones are destined to disappointment.  The answer to strong bones for
          a lifetime is a diet based on alkaline foods—vegetables and fruits.
          Exercise and an active life have a very positive influence.

          <h1>Research Fails to Support Flu Shot’s Value</h1>
          <p><strong>Influenza vaccination: policy versus evidence</strong> by Tom Jefferson in the
          October 28, 2006 issue of the British Medical Journal reported after a
          thorough analysis of current research that, “Evidence from systematic
          reviews shows that inactivated vaccines have little or no effect on
          the effects measured…Little comparative evidence exists on the safety
          of these vaccines…Reasons for the current gap between policy and
          evidence are unclear, but given the huge resources involved, a
          re-evaluation should be urgently undertaken.”1  The author argues the
          reason any benefits are reported for flu vaccines may be that those
          who get vaccinated are more active, healthier and wealthier people
          than those who do not get vaccinations—and because of these superior
          health qualities of these people—not the vaccination—they had better
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comment: I am often asked whether or not I recommend getting a “flu”
          shot.  I have changed my opinion on this many times over my
          thirty-five years of medical practice and I reserve the right to
          change my opinion again in the future.  As a young doctor in the late
          1970s, I ran a general practice during a time when an epidemic of
          swine flu was predicted—but that viral infection never occurred.
          However, two of my patients developed permanent paralysis below the
          waist after immunization with the swine flu vaccine, and some people
          believe that was not a coincidence.  This left me no longer
          recommending flu shots.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Years later, after I personally had suffered from a couple of episodes
          of brutal flu, and when the research I was reading seemed to support
          flu shots, I began to take a more positive stand.  However, I
          continued to have concerns about their effectiveness and safety. The
          vaccines are based on the three strains of influenza viruses that were
          common the previous year—they are not based on a virus that will
          infect people the year they are vaccinated.  Second, these vaccines
          contain mercury and aluminum.2,3  Mercury is a recognized poison,
          suspected to be linked to autism; and aluminum is known to be toxic to
          the nervous system and is involved in the cause of Alzheimer’s
          disease. The mercury is used as a preservative and the aluminum
          enhances the immune response to the killed viruses in the vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>  
          A letter to the editor4 that followed questioned the effectiveness of
          flu shots. The writer pointed out, “A 2005 US National Institutes of
          Health review of over 30 influenza seasons could not correlate
          increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with declining mortality
          rates in any age group and concluded that observational studies
          substantially overestimate vaccination benefit.” 5
        </p>
        <p>  
          Where do I now stand?  For several years I personally did get a flu
          shot, but the last two I have not.  I now recommend that people who
          are old and frail err on the side of getting their annual flu shot,
          because complications, such as pneumonia, from a bout of influenza
          could easily be fatal. I worry that many people believe the flu shot
          will protect them from getting a very deadly viral disease known as
          avian (bird) flu—this is not true.  I also think it is long overdue
          for the pharmaceutical companies to start making safer vaccines,
          without the aluminum and mercury.

          <h1>Cow's Milk Promotes Acne</h1>
          <p>
        Milk consumption and acne in adolescent girls by Clement Adebamowo in
        the May 2006 issue of Dermatology Online Journal found after studying
        6,094 girls, aged 9 to 15, that those consuming two or more glasses of
        milk daily compared to girls consuming less than one glass, had 20% to
        30% more acne.  In their research, low-fat milk was implicated,
        suggesting that is was not the fat, but other ingredients, that promoted
        pimples. They proposed that milk protein causes a rise in the body of a
        powerful growth hormone, Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), which in
        turn promotes acne.  Male hormones, called androgens, are linked to acne
        and these are also increased by consumption of milk and cheese. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Comment:</strong>  A common mantra heard from doctors is, “Diet has nothing to do
        with acne.”  The truth is the few studies done show the opposite: diet
        does cause and aggravate the severity of acne.  Previously, I have held
        the position that the fat in the food was the primary culprit.  Fats and
        oils from the diet end up on the skin, where acne-causing bacteria feed
        upon them.  These authors add other dimensions to the diet-acne
        connection—focusing on milk products, and more specifically, the dairy
        proteins.  You should know that all animal proteins, as well as isolated
        soy proteins, cause a significant rise in IGF-1 levels in the body.
        </p>
        <p>
        My experience has been that people (adults and teenagers) who switch to
        the low-fat version of our diet (avoiding nuts, seeds, avocados, and
        olives) experience an immediate reduction in the oiliness of the skin,
        and particularly the face; and within a month, they notice a dramatic
        reduction in the acne. (To learn more read my November 2003 newsletter
        article: Acne Has Everything to do With Diet.)
        </p>
        <h1>Review of the Evidence that Diet Causes Autism</h1>

        <p><strong>Elimination diets in autism spectrum disorders: any wheat amidst the
        chaff?</strong> by George W. Christison published in the April 2006 issue of
        Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics reported their analysis of the
        scientific studies connecting autism with diet, and concluded, “The
        literature currently available suggests that diets eliminating both
        gluten and casein (rather than either alone) should be studied first and
        that outcome measures should include assessments of nonverbal
        cognition.”1  The most popular diets evaluated removed both gluten—a
        protein commonly found in wheat, barley, and rye products—and casein, a
        protein in cow’s milk.  Benefits described by proponents of this kind of
        dietary treatment are improvements in a wide range of autism symptoms,
        with better social engagement and verbal skills commonly experienced. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Comment:</strong> Diet therapy should be the first treatment recommended by all
        doctors—it is low-cost and side-effect free, and could easily lead to a
        cure.  Besides, what other choices are available—certainly, not anything
        of real value from the pharmaceutical industry. The mechanisms by which
        diet can cause autism are easily explainable. Diet can produce an excess
        of opium-like compounds which affect the brain, and an unhealthy diet
        can damage the intestinal wall increasing its the permeability—a “leaky
        gut” forms, which allows passage into the blood of neuroactive
        substances, like the opium-like compounds. Eliminating casein and gluten
        from the diet reverses these effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest step for a family to take would be to stop feeding all
          dairy products (including skim milk, cheese, yogurt, and anything else
          derived from cow’s milk—other animal milks are also excluded) and high
          gluten foods, such as wheat, barley and rye.  However, the best chance
          for success, and my recommendation, would be to start an effective
          elimination diet immediately.  Only the foods least likely to cause
          harm are consumed.  My December 2002 newsletter article—Diet for the
          Desperate—provides guidelines for the most effective elimination diet.
          Benefits should be expected to begin to be seen in 4 to 7 days;
          however, I have seen improvements in similar diseases take as long as
          4 months.  Schizophrenia is a related disease, and a similar dietary
          approach should be tried with this condition.
        </p>

        <p>
          The American Institute for Cancer Research says that health experts
          agree; putting mostly plant-based foods on your plate is the
          healthiest diet you can consume.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we believe a plant-based “diet” isn’t so much of a strict diet, as it
          is a chosen health conscious lifestyle for many— and it’s one of the best ways
          to support a healthy mind and body in recovery.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Plant foods (aka: the unprocessed foods found in nature) provide your body with
          healing anti-inflammatory compounds, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals.
          All of these nutrients are crucial for healthy liver function, which in turn
          promotes restful sleep, fewer cravings, and a happier mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you may know, your liver is the primary organ of detoxification and is
          responsible for eliminating harmful toxins from drugs and alcohol from your
          system. While your liver is an extremely capable detoxifier, eating plant based
          foods that are rich in nutrients and support healthy liver function can
          accelerate your healing, and make a huge difference in how well your digestion
          and elimination functions overall.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Heavily processed, deep fried, fatty and oily foods can slow your liver function
          down, which is why choosing to eat a plant-based diet that eliminates these
          foods is a huge step towards feeling your best.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h1>What is a Plant Based Diet?</h1>
          <p>
          When you eat plant based, you simply focus on eating the nutrient-rich
          unprocessed foods found in nature such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts,
          seeds and legumes, while limiting— or ideally— completely removing processed
          foods.
          </p>
          <p>
          Most processed foods contain very few nutrients and are known to cause
          inflammation in the body, which prevents you from healing. These foods include
          refined sugar and flour, caffeine, dairy products, and heavily processed oils.
          </p>
          Eggs, meat, poultry, dairy and fish are typically not part of a plant based
          diet, however, plant based diets can vary depending on a person’s unique needs.
          For example, some people may eat plant based 90% of the time, but choose to
          consume small amounts of high quality, organic animal products if they are weak,
          deficient, or may need certain nutrients in animal products for therapeutic
          reasons (such as bioavailable iron and vitamin B12).

          A plant-based diet isn’t meant to be restrictive. It is simply a sustainable way
          of adopting healthier eating habits to provide your body with maximum nutrition.

          Let’s take a look at three reasons to transition to a plant based diet during
          your recovery (and beyond).

          <h1>3 Ways a Plant-Based Diet Can Help You with Addiction Recovery </h1>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>A Plant Based Diet May Help You Address the Root Cause of Addiction Sooner</strong>
            <p>
              A diet that is focused on whole, unprocessed foods eliminates
              the foods we find most addictive, such as caffeine, refined
              sugar (candy and sweets), and processed carbs (bread, cakes,
              donuts, pastries, pasta). These foods can become addictive
              because they can cause a rapid surge in dopamine levels.

              While these foods may seem like the lesser of the evils during
              the recovery process, they are merely a band-aid solution and
              substitute for more harmful substances, and all the same, they
              serve as a distraction and provide comfort when challenging
              emotions surface— which prevents you from getting to the bottom
              of your addiction.
              
              On the other hand, certain plant foods such as nuts, seeds,
              bananas and raw cacao can gently boost dopamine levels (which
              makes them less addictive) while also providing several
              essential nutrients that aid in liver function.
              
              It’s also worth noting that a predominantly plant based can help
              reduce your risk of stroke and heart disease, which are risk
              factors for those who heavily consume alcohol (1).

              <strong>The Fiber From Plant Foods Improves Gut Health, Which Can Directly
              Improve Your Energy and Mood</strong>
            
            <p>
              When you think of healing from addiction recovery, your gut may
              not be the first thing to come to mind. However, the gut and the
              brain are interconnected (this is known as the gut-brain axis),
              and this connection explains how your gut health can directly
              impact your mood and cravings for addictive substances (2).
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, serotonin is produced in the gut— the neurotransmitter that helps
              you feel good. When your serotonin levels are low, depression, anxiety, and
              cravings for addictive substances can increase. This is only one example of how
              your gut health impacts how you feel on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p> 
              All fruit, vegetables and whole grains contain fiber, which supports healthy
              digestion and elimination by keeping your bowel movements regular. Fiber also
              acts as a prebiotic, which feeds your body’s natural stores of healthy bacteria,
              called probiotics — which rule the health of your entire digestive system. As
              you can see, fiber is a critical nutrient for a healthy gut.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plant foods are the most fibrous foods on the planet— so luckily, eating an
              abundance of fruit, vegetables and whole grains on a plant based diet makes it
              easy to meet your daily fiber requirements. If you’re a woman between the ages
              of 18-50, you’ll need about 21 grams of fiber per day, while men require around
              30-38 grams.

              <strong>
              Organic Plant Foods Provide Up to 40% More Antioxidants Than Conventional Produce
              </strong>
              <p>
                Plant based diets also focus on the quality of foods, which
                means choosing local or organic whenever possible because
                they’re lower in pesticides and higher in nutrients. While it is
                not always realistic or affordable to choose organic year round,
                you can follow the Clean Fifteen and Dirty Dozen List to see
                which foods should be purchased organic whenever possible.

                Studies have found that organic produce contains higher levels of antioxidants
                and significantly lower levels of metals such as cadmium, which can lead to mood
                and neurological disorders. Scientists discovered that organic crops lack the
                synthetic chemical pesticides of their conventional counterparts, which helps
                organic plants to produce greater amounts of polyphenols and phenols. These
                antioxidants help prevent diseases caused by oxidative stress, which can be
                caused by excessive alcohol consumption, cocaine and other recreational drug
                use.

                By switching to organic plant-based produce, you can increase the amount of
                antioxidants in your diet by 20- 40 percent. These antioxidants support both
                phases of liver detoxification, which neutralize harmful  drugs and toxins to be
                eliminated safely from your body.

              <strong>
              Start Simple With Having One Green Smoothie Per Day
              </strong>
              <p>
              Your first step to starting a plant-based diet is to establish a healthy eating
              routine. People in early recovery need to develop a foundation for healthier
              eating. Your diet has a big impact on your recovery.

              Not sure where to start? Keep it simple. Choose to begin your day with a green
              smoothie as you search Pinterest for easy and delicious combinations with fresh
              fruit, vegetables, coconut water, and greens. If you’re pressed for time in the
              mornings, wash and chop your ingredients the night before so that all you need
              to do is throw your ingredients in a blender, and pour into a to-go cup.

              <strong>
              Don’t Forget To Snack on Fruit (Nature’s #1 Fast Food) 
              </strong>
            </li>
            <p>
              Aside from providing essential nutrients, fruit offers a quick
              burst of energy and soothes sweet cravings. Plus, fruit is
              nature’s ultimate “fast food” that you can grab from a fruit bowl
              on your way out the door— no meal prep, clean up or elaborate
              gourmet cooking necessary!

              <strong>
              Stock Up on Leafy Greens
              </strong>
            </li>
            <p>
              Leafy greens are one of the most powerful foods for liver health,
              especially when your body is going through a more intense
              detoxification period. Leafy greens include spinach, collard
              greens, baby kale, arugula, romaine lettuce and butter lettuce.
              You can easily add a handful of these to your smoothie, have a
              small side salad with your dinner each day, or steam in a small
              amount of unrefined coconut oil and pure sea salt, which makes a
              tasty side dish to any meal. 
            </p>

              <strong>
              Add Protein and Healthy Fats to Every Meal
              </strong> 
            </li>
            <p>
              While fruits and vegetables are a great source of antioxidants and
              energy boosting carbohydrates (and they do also contain smaller
              amounts of plant protein), you still need to incorporate higher
              protein foods to repair damaged cells.
            </p>
            <p>
              Protein and healthy fats also help balance your blood sugar levels which can
              reduce sugar cravings, fatigue and irritability, and keep your appetite
              satisfied for longer periods of time. A few examples of plant based proteins and
              healthy fats are lentils, beans, wild rice, quinoa, and tempeh, as well as hemp
              hearts, avocado, nuts and seeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes to eating for addiction recovery, it’s not about focusing on which
              foods to stay away from and feeling restrictive with your diet, but rather
              focusing on adding in more nutrient dense foods to it. Nutrition should never
              seem punitive, but rather a helpful and important component of your healing and
              recovery process, and overall healthy lifestyle.
