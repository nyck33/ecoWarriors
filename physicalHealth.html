                <strong>Pat McAuley</strong> describes the impact that food has on his life
                and why he is an advocate of the health and environmental
                benefits of plant-based living. Pat McAuley is a
                Boston-based serial entrepreneur, author, speaker, and
                startup consultant for ethical/plant-based companies. He has
                started and successfully run companies in the tech space and
                food and beverage industries and has extensive experience
                building brands from scratch. After a plant-based diet
                changed his life, Pat shifted his focus to building and
                supporting businesses in the plant-based space. He is now an
                outspoken advocate of the health and environmental benefits
                of plant-based living. Pat is the host of the popular Eat
                Green Make Green Podcast and is currently working on opening
                one of the nation’s first fully plant-based beer halls,
                Rewild. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED
                conference format but independently organized by a local
                community. Learn more at

            <h1>THE REAL “HIGH QUALITY” FOODS</h1> 
            Given all the issues, the “high
            quality” aspect of animal protein might be more appropriately
            described as <br><h1>“high risk”.</h1>
            <p>
            And there’s no need to obsess about getting enough protein
            either. If you are eating a sensible variety of plant foods
            (e.g., vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, roots, nuts, and
            seeds), and you are eating enough calories (i.e., you feel
            satisfied), there is no need to worry about protein adequacy.   
            </p>
            <p>
            The amino acids we need are structurally identical regardless of
            the source. However, as discussed above, there are serious
            health implications depending on whether the amino acids are
            packaged within animal or plant foods. Dr. Walter Willett, the
            chair of Harvard’s Department of Nutrition, said it well:
            </p>
            <p>
            “To the metabolic systems engaged in protein production and
            repair, it is immaterial whether amino acids come from animal or
            plant protein. However, protein is not consumed in isolation.
            Instead, it is packaged with a host of other nutrients.   
            </p>
            <p>
            He therefore recommends that you “pick the best protein packages
            by emphasizing plant sources of protein rather than animal
            sources.   
            </p>
            <p>
            In the end,
            <a
                href="food.html"
                target="_blank">
              <strong style=color:lime>plant foods</strong></a> 
             are the real “high quality” foods that
            we should be eating for optimal health.
