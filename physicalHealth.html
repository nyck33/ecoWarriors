                <h3><strong>Five Major Poisons Inherently Found in Animal Foods</strong></h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                Protein, fat, cholesterol, methionine (a sulfur-containing amino
                acid), and dietary acids, which are all superabundant in animal
                foods, are poisoning nearly everyone following the standard
                Western diet. Most people cannot fathom this, because it takes
                four or more decades of consumption before disability,
                disfigurement, and death become common from these endogenous
                toxins. This long latent period fools the public into thinking
                there is no harm done by choosing an animal-food-based diet. If
                the case were one of instantaneous feedback—one plate of fried
                eggs caused excruciating chest pains, paralysis from a stroke
                followed a prime rib dinner, or a hard cancerous lump appeared
                within a week of a grilled cheese sandwich—then eating animal
                foods would be widely recognized as an exceedingly unwise
                choice. Similar failures to appreciate slow poisonings from our
                lifestyle choices are seen with tobacco and alcohol use. If one
                package of cigarettes were followed by a week on a respirator or
                a bottle or two of gin caused hepatic (liver) coma then no one
                would indulge in these instruments of long-drawn-out death
                either. The difference defining the failure to take long overdue
                actions is that the dangers from tobacco and alcohol use are
                universally known and accepted, whereas almost everyone
                considers red meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products necessary
                parts of a healthy diet.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4><strong>The Art of Selling Slow Poisons: Distract the Consumer</strong></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sellers of animal foods for human consumption draw in customers
                with the marketing strategy of “unique positioning”—each
                industry tries to make its merchandise stand apart from other
                foods by promoting a nutrient that is especially plentiful in
                its product. Over time this effective advertising approach has
                meant that the mention of calcium brings to mind milk and
                cheese, iron has become synonymous with beef, and eggs are well
                known as the “best source of high quality protein.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because these highly sensationalized nutrients are always
                plentiful in basic plant foods, illnesses from deficiencies of
                these nutrients are essentially unknown, as long as there is
                enough food to eat. Thus, there are no real nutritional
                advantages to choosing red meat, poultry, dairy, and egg
                products with an especially high density of one particular
                nutrient. Ironically, milk and cheese are iron deficient, and
                red meat, poultry, and eggs (unless you eat the shells) contain
                almost no calcium.   
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Focusing on the abundance of an individual nutrient accomplishes
                an even more insidious marketing goal; it diverts the
                consumer’s, and oftentimes the professional dietitian’s,
                attention away from the harmful impact on the human body of
                consuming all kinds of animal foods.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my 42-years of providing medical care I have never seen a
                patient sickened by eating potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, rice,
                beans, fruits, and/or vegetables (unspoiled and uncontaminated).
                However, during my everyday practice I have witnessed (just like
                every other practicing medical doctor has) a wide diversity of
                diseases, including heart attacks, strokes, type-2 diabetes,
                arthritis, osteoporosis, and cancer, from eating fresh killed
                and/or collected, as well as processed and/or preserved,
                animal-derived foods.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4><strong>A Simplified View of Animal-food Poisoning</strong></h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                Animal foods—be they from cow, pig, or chicken muscles or the
                ovum of a bird or the lactation fluids of a mammal—are all so
                similar in their nutritional makeup and their impact on human
                health that they should be considered as the same (see the
                comparison tables at the end of this article). In order to avoid
                the confusion created by the marketing strategy of “unique
                positioning,” lets look at different kinds of animal products
                mixed together to make one food; and compare them to their
                antithesis, starches. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to blend together red meat, chicken, eggs, and cheese,
                which most Americans do three or more times a day in their
                stomachs, the end product would be a highly acidic mixture of
                mostly protein, fat, and water—each individual food having
                contributed a similar amount of each component. A blend of
                various starches—beans, rice, potatoes, and sweet potatoes—would
                produce an opposite in composition. 
            </p>

                <h4><strong>The Five Overloads from Animal Foods that Poison Us</strong></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                Protein, fat, cholesterol, sulfur-containing amino acids
                (methionine, for example), and dietary acids poison us when
                consumed in amounts that exceed the body’s metabolic
                capabilities to detoxify and eliminate the excesses. Compared to
                the proper human diet, which is based on starches (see my
                February 2009 newsletter), animal foods burden us with three
                times more protein, fifteen times more fat, greater than 100
                times more cholesterol, four times more methionine, and at least
                ten times more dietary acid. Furthermore, the toxic effects of
                these poisons are interactive. For example, excesses of protein,
                methionine, and dietary acids work together to destroy the
                bones. Excesses of dietary fat and cholesterol combine their
                deleterious effects to damage the arteries (atherosclerosis) and
                promote cancer. Let me provide some more details on how these
                five destructive elements from animal foods ruin your health. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4><strong>Protein Overload</strong></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once your protein needs are met then the excess must be
                eliminated from your body, primarily by your liver and kidneys.
                You can notice an overload of protein by the strong smell of
                urea in your body sweat and urine. The work of eliminating
                excess protein takes a toll even on healthy people. On average,
                25% of kidney function is lost over a lifetime (70 years) from
                consuming the high animal-protein Western diet.1,2  For people
                with already damaged livers and kidneys, consuming excess
                protein will speed up the processes that lead to complete organ
                failure.3-7 Excess protein damages the bones. Doubling the
                dietary intake of protein increases the loss of calcium into the
                urine by 50%, fostering the development of osteoporosis and
                kidney stones.8 
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4><strong>Lipotoxicity (Fat Overload)</strong></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                The most recent report (for 2007 to 2008) on the epidemic of
                obesity in the US finds 33.8% of adults obese with 68.0% of all
                adults overweight.9 Dietary fats are almost effortlessly stored
                in your body fat.10 When consumed in excess, dietary fats also
                result in a surplus of fats stored in your liver, heart, and
                muscles. From all this over-accumulation, insulin resistance
                develops, contributing to other health problems, including heart
                disease, strokes, and type-2 diabetes.11 The extra pounds you
                carry around cause damage to the joints of your lower
                extremities (osteoarthritis). Excess fat in your diet and on
                your body alters your cellular metabolism, promoting cancers by
                many already discovered mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4><strong>Cholesterol Overload</strong></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cholesterol is only found in animal products. As an animal, you
                make all the cholesterol you need. Unfortunately, your capacity
                to eliminate it is limited to a little more than the amount you
                make. As a result, the cholesterol added by eating animal foods
                accumulates in your body parts, including your skin, tendons,
                and arteries. Cholesterol deposited in your arteries is a major
                contributor to vascular diseases of your heart and brain.13
                Cholesterol also facilitates cancer development.14
            </p>
            <p>
             <h4><strong>Sulfur Toxicity</strong></h4>   
            </p>
            <p>
                Overconsumption of sulfur-containing amino acids (for example,
                methionine) will cause you many unwelcome problems.15 Most
                noticeably, sulfur stinks, like rotten eggs, causing halitosis,
                body odor, and noxious flatus. Methionine is metabolized into
                homocysteine, a risk factor for heart attacks, strokes,
                peripheral vascular disease, venous thrombosis, dementia,
                Alzheimer’s disease, and depression. Sulfur feeds cancerous
                tumors and is known to be toxic to the tissues of the intestine.
                Sulfur-containing amino acids are metabolized into sulfuric
                acid—one of the most potent acids found in nature.

                <h4><strong>Acid Overload</strong></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                After ingestion, your body must neutralize the over-abundance of
                endogenous dietary acids in the animal foods you eat. Your bones
                are the primary buffering system of your body.16-20 They
                counteract these dietary acids by releasing alkaline materials
                (carbonate, citrate, and sodium)—thereby the bones dissolve.
                Acids from animal foods also raise cortisol (steroid) levels in
                your body.21 An excess of steroid is another mechanism for
                further bone loss. The net result from this chronic acid
                poisoning is kidney stones and osteoporosis.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4><strong>Detoxifying with a Starch-based Diet</strong></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply by making the right food choices you will immediately
                relieve yourself from the burden of five dietary poisons
                inherently found in animal foods. At the same time you will be
                reducing your intake of pesticides, antibiotics, and other toxic
                chemicals found in high concentrations in most animal foods. You
                will also be adding generous amounts of complex carbohydrates,
                dietary fibers, alkaline substances, and a healthy balance of
                vitamins, minerals, and essential phyto-chemicals to your body.
                And finally, you will be avoiding exposure to animal-borne,
                infectious microbes (bacteria, viruses, parasites, and prions)
                that can cause acute and deadly illnesses. Give yourself a break
                today: choose starches, free of the five endogenous poisons
                superabundant in animal foods.

                <strong>Pat McAuley</strong> describes the impact that food has on his life
                and why he is an advocate of the health and environmental
                benefits of plant-based living. Pat McAuley is a
                Boston-based serial entrepreneur, author, speaker, and
                startup consultant for ethical/plant-based companies. He has
                started and successfully run companies in the tech space and
                food and beverage industries and has extensive experience
                building brands from scratch. After a plant-based diet
                changed his life, Pat shifted his focus to building and
                supporting businesses in the plant-based space. He is now an
                outspoken advocate of the health and environmental benefits
                of plant-based living. Pat is the host of the popular Eat

            <h3><strong>THE REAL “HIGH QUALITY” FOODS</strong></h3> 
            Given all the issues, the “high
            quality” aspect of animal protein might be more appropriately
            described as <br><h3><strong>“high risk”.</strong></h3>
            <p>
            And there’s no need to obsess about getting enough protein
            either. If you are eating a sensible variety of plant foods
            (e.g., vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, roots, nuts, and
            seeds), and you are eating enough calories (i.e., you feel
            satisfied), there is no need to worry about protein adequacy.   
            </p>
            <p>
            The amino acids we need are structurally identical regardless of
            the source. However, as discussed above, there are serious
            health implications depending on whether the amino acids are
            packaged within animal or plant foods. Dr. Walter Willett, the
            chair of Harvard’s Department of Nutrition, said it well:
            </p>
            <p>
            “To the metabolic systems engaged in protein production and
            repair, it is immaterial whether amino acids come from animal or
            plant protein. However, protein is not consumed in isolation.
            Instead, it is packaged with a host of other nutrients.   
            </p>
            <p>
            He therefore recommends that you “pick the best protein packages
            by emphasizing plant sources of protein rather than animal
            sources.   
            </p>
            <p>
            In the end,
            <a href="food.html" target="_blank"><strong>plant foods</strong></a> 
             are the real “high quality” foods that
            we should be eating for optimal health.   
            </p>
