              <h1>Clicking Here</h1></a>
              I strongly suggest reading the original as it is cited with sources at the bottom
              of their page.
              </p>
            <p>
            Today, of course, we know that most proteins from both plants
            and animals are “complete proteins” (meaning they contain all of
            the essential amino acids we need).1 However, people sometimes
            use the term “low quality” to refer to plant proteins because
            they typically have a lower proportion of these essential amino
            acids as compared to animal proteins.
            </p>
            <p>
            But it’s important to understand that having a higher proportion of essential
            amino acids, as animal protein does, is actually damaging (not advantageous) for
            our health. We outline seven ways that animal protein damages your health.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>1. ANIMAL PROTEIN AND FIBER (OR TOTAL LACK THEREOF)</h2>>
                Unlike plant
                protein, which comes packaged with fiber, antioxidants, and
                phytonutrients, animal protein comes with exactly none of the
                foregoing. To this point, meat, eggs, poultry, dairy, fish and
                other animal foods have absolutely no fiber whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many people, in their effort to “get enough” protein, tend to
                eat large amounts of animal foods, which displaces plant foods
                that have these important nutrients. Fiber deficiencies, in
                particular, are far more common than not.  
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, The Institute of Medicine recommends that men
                consume 38 grams of fiber, but the average adult only eats about
                15 grams per day—less than half the recommended amount. In fact,
                according to the USDA, almost all Americans (~95%) do not get an
                adequate amount of dietary fiber. 
            </p>
            <p>
                High fiber intake is associated with decreased cancer risk,
                specifically colon and breast cancers, as well as lower risk of
                ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, constipation and
                diverticulitis. It may also reduce the risk of stroke, high
                cholesterol, and heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>2. ANIMAL PROTEIN AND IGF-1 (INCREASED CANCER RISK) </h2>
                    When we
                ingest proteins that have a higher proportion of the essential
                amino acids (which is a characteristic of animal protein), it
                results in our bodies producing higher levels of the hormone
                insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).
            </p>
            <p>
                This hormone stimulates cell division and growth in both healthy
                and cancer cells and, for this reason, having higher circulating
                levels of IGF-1 has been consistently associated with increased
                cancer risk, proliferation, and malignancy.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>3. ANIMAL PROTEIN AND TMAO</h2>
            Consuming animal protein also results in us having higher circulating levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).

            TMAO is a substance that injures the lining of our vessels, creates
            inflammation, and facilitates the formation of cholesterol plaques in our blood
            vessels. And that, of course, is highly problematic for cardiovascular health.
            </p>
            <p>
            TMAO is created by complex interactions involving our gut flora
            and the nutrients in the food we eat. And when we eat animal
            foods, it alters our gut flora in such a way that facilitates
            the creation of TMAO.9,10
            </p>
            <p>
            So, consuming animal foods result in higher TMAO levels, which is damaging to
            our vessels. Even without all of the other problematic aspects of animal foods,
            this one issue involving TMAO is, according to the recent president of the
            American College of Cardiology Dr. Kim A. Williams, sufficient by itself for
            people to vigorously avoid animal foods.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>4. ANIMAL PROTEIN AND PHOSPHORUS Animal protein contains high</h2>
            levels of phosphorus. And when we consume high amounts of
            phosphorus, one of the ways our bodies normalize the level of
            phosphorus is with a hormone called fibroblast growth factor 23
            (FGF23)
            </p>
            <p>
            FGF23 has been found to be harmful to our blood vessels. It can
            also lead to hypertrophy of the cardiac ventricle (abnormal
            enlargement of our cardiac muscle) and is associated with heart
            attacks, sudden death, and heart failure.12,13 So eating animal
            protein with its high concentration of phosphorus can result in
            increased levels of this hormone in our bodies, which in turn is
            highly problematic for our health.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>5. ANIMAL PROTEIN, HEME IRON, AND FREE RADICALS</h2> 
            Iron is the most
            abundant metal in the human body. We can consume it in two
            forms: (a) heme iron, found widely in animal foods like meat,
            poultry, and fish; and (b) non-heme iron found widely in plant
            foods.
            </p>
            <p>
            One of the problems with heme iron is that it can convert less
            reactive oxidants into highly reactive free radicals And free
            radicals can damage different cell structures like proteins,
            membranes, and DNA.
            </p>
            <p>
            Heme iron can also catalyze the formation of N-nitroso compounds
            in our bodies, which are potent carcinogens. So, not
            surprisingly, high intake of heme iron has been associated with
            many kinds of gastrointestinal cancers as well as other
            pathologies.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is true that heme iron has higher absorption rates and
            bioavailability than non-heme iron. However, iron itself can
            cause oxidative stress and DNA damage, so with iron generally,
            it’s not always a situation where “more is better.”
            </p>
            <p>
            While we definitely need iron, the absorption and
            bioavailability of iron from a well-rounded plant-based diet is
            generally adequate, and we can avoid the problems associated
            with heme iron and other negative health attributes of animal
            foods.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>6. HIGHER SULFUR-CONTAINING AMINO ACIDS AND BONE HEALTH PROBLEMS</h2>
            Animal proteins also have, in general, higher concentrations of
            sulfur-containing amino acids, which can induce a subtle state
            of acidosis when metabolized.18 One of the mechanisms our bodies
            use to compensate for this acidosis is leaching calcium from our
            bones to help neutralize the increased acidity. Over time, this
            can have a detrimental effect on bone health.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is thought to be one of the reasons why some studies have
            found that populations with higher dairy consumption, as well as
            higher consumption of animal protein in general, also have a
            higher incidence of bone fractures.    
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>7. ANIMAL PROTEIN AND CHOLESTEROL</h2> Most animal foods contain
            saturated fat and cholesterol (this is true for even so-called
            “lean” meats like chicken, turkey, and salmon, regardless of how
            they are cooked or prepared—even if boiled, baked, or steamed).
            
            </p>
            <p>
            As humans, we do not need to consume any cholesterol, since our
            bodies synthesize all the cholesterol we need for our
            physiologic functions. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Eating cholesterol despite this fact is problematic for our
            health, as it increases our risk of developing heart
            disease—currently the No. 1 cause of death for both men and
            women in the United States.   
            </p>
            <p>
            Atherosclerosis, or plaques of cholesterol that accumulate in
            the lining of our vessels, is exquisitely less common on a
            plant-based vegan diet devoid of animal products. And some
            studies have found that eating this way can even reverse
            atherosclerosis.

            <h1>THE REAL “HIGH QUALITY” FOODS</h1> 
            Given all the issues, the “high
            quality” aspect of animal protein might be more appropriately
            described as <br><h1>“high risk”.</h1>
            <p>
            And there’s no need to obsess about getting enough protein
            either. If you are eating a sensible variety of plant foods
            (e.g., vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, roots, nuts, and
            seeds), and you are eating enough calories (i.e., you feel
            satisfied), there is no need to worry about protein adequacy.   
            </p>
            <p>
            The amino acids we need are structurally identical regardless of
            the source. However, as discussed above, there are serious
            health implications depending on whether the amino acids are
            packaged within animal or plant foods. Dr. Walter Willett, the
            chair of Harvard’s Department of Nutrition, said it well:
            </p>
            <p>
            “To the metabolic systems engaged in protein production and
            repair, it is immaterial whether amino acids come from animal or
            plant protein. However, protein is not consumed in isolation.
            Instead, it is packaged with a host of other nutrients.   
            </p>
            <p>
            He therefore recommends that you “pick the best protein packages
            by emphasizing plant sources of protein rather than animal
            sources.   
            </p>
            <p>
            In the end,
            <a
                href="food.html"
                target="_blank">
              <strong style=color:lime>plant foods</strong></a> 
             are the real “high quality” foods that
            we should be eating for optimal health.
