        <strong>The BBC website</strong></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people eat factory-farmed meat while also <strong>abhorring animal
          cruelty</strong> 
          In this adaptation from her new book, the psychological
          scientist Dr Julia Shaw explains what the <strong>“meat paradox”</strong> can tell us
          about moral decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Money changes our relationship with morality. The very existence of
          money, along with complex business and distribution channels, acts as
          a buffer between ourselves and the origin of our products. This can
          make us behave in ways that are deeply unethical.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can prove it to you. Do you think animal torture is evil? And do you
          also eat factory-farmed meat?  Many people who would strongly
          disagree, in principle, with animal cruelty also eat meat that has
          been raised in terrible conditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this myself. I try to eat a mostly plant-based diet, but like
          the majority of people in most Western countries, I do not eat this
          diet exclusively.
        </p>
        <p>
          By reframing the same issue and adding a price tag we make some acts
          seem far less offensive. We can’t see them first hand, so they feel
          like they are unrelated to us. All we can see is the price.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? When we understand why we eat meat that we know has been raised
          in poor conditions, we can begin to understand many other forms of
          behaviour that conflict with deeply held moral principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Internal conflict</h3>
          According to psychologists Brock Bastian and Steve Loughnan, who do
          research on the topic in Australia, the “meat paradox” is the
          “psychological conflict between people’s dietary preference for meat
          and their moral response to animal suffering”. They argue that
          “bringing harm to others is inconsistent with a view of oneself as a
          moral person. As such, meat consumption leads to negative effects for
          meat-eaters because they are confronted with a view of themselves that
          is unfavourable: how can I be a good person and also eat meat?”
        </p>
        <p>
          This moral conflict doesn’t just threaten our enjoyment of eating
          meat, it threatens our identity. In order to protect our identities we
          establish habits and social structures that make us feel better.
          Meat-eating is tied to social customs, so that holidays are defined as
          a time to feast on flesh with friends and family. Some people may also
          use it as a signal of masculinity, claiming that it helps define
          someone as a real man, or that we humans evolved as super-predators
          who were meant to eat meat. And despite animal products being linked
          to all kinds of poor health outcomes, some people tsk when we say that
          we want to go vegan (“How will you get enough protein?”), and friends
          start "forgetting" to invite us to dinner parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          With many decisions, including the choice to eat meat, the excuses we
          make are largely post hoc – after we have chosen to indulge we need to
          justify why the behaviour was OK, and why it is OK to do it again. And
          we need the excuses, or else we feel like bad people.

        <p>
          When we say one thing but do another, or hold inconsistent beliefs,
          psychologists call it cognitive dissonance. The term was developed by
          Leon Festinger, who first used it in 1957. The classic experiment in
          this field was published by Festinger and James Carlsmith in 1959. In
          it, they asked: “What happens to a person’s private opinion if he is
          forced to do or say something contrary to that opinion?” In their
          experiment, they had 71 men complete two tasks. First, the men were
          asked to put 12 round wooden spools into a tray, empty the tray and
          put the spools back in the tray, repeatedly, for half an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the participants were given a board containing 48 square wooden
          pegs. They were asked to turn each peg by a quarter turn clockwise,
          then another quarter turn, repeatedly, again for half an hour. While
          they did this, a researcher watched and wrote things down. These were
          intentionally boring tasks. Really, really boring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the participants thought it was their performance that was
          being measured, it was actually what came next that interested the
          researchers. After their two boring tasks, participants were taken
          back into the waiting room. They were told that the person sitting
          there was the next participant. For one-third of the participants,
          they simply sat down without anything else being mentioned. For the
          other two-thirds, however, the researcher asked whether they would lie
          to the next participant. They would even be paid for their lie. Half
          were told that they would be paid $1 for their lie, and the other half
          were told that they would be paid $20 for their lie (which in the
          1950s was a lot). When they said yes, the researcher then handed them
          a piece of paper, and instructed them to make the points that were
          written on it: “It was very enjoyable”, “I had a lot of fun”, “I
          enjoyed myself”, “It was very interesting”, “It was intriguing”, “It
          was exciting”.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the researchers really wanted to know was what impact this lie,
          and the compensation for it, would have on participants’ rating of the
          task. They wondered whether participants would actually come to think
          they enjoyed the boring task, just because they told someone else it
          was fun. And how would being paid influence this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Who do you think rated the experiment as the most enjoyable? The
        control group, who had not been asked to lie, rated the task as boring
        and said that they would not do it again. The participants paid $20 also
        rated the task negatively. However, the participants paid $1 rated the
        experiment as far more enjoyable than the other two groups, and were
        more likely to say they would sign up to participate in similar
        experiments in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
        What happened? Being paid $1 was probably not seen by the participants
        as sufficient incentive to lie. Accordingly, they experienced
        cognitive dissonance. “Why did I say that it was enjoyable when it
        wasn’t? Surely not for a measly $1?” Since the participants could not
        go back and change their behaviour, or un-participate in the
        experiment, the option available to them was to change their belief –
        it must have actually been enjoyable.For the $20 condition this was
        not necessary, as they could explain their behaviour as the result of
        the hefty and easy financial incentive. This was the first of many
        experiments to show that we often bring our beliefs in line with our
        behaviour, and that money can change the way we do this.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 1962 Festinger further formalised his ideas. He stated that although we
        believe ourselves to be generally consistent – in our behaviours, beliefs and
        attitudes – sometimes we go rogue. This inconsistency he called dissonance,
        while consistency he called consonance. He summarised his cognitive dissonance
        theory as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>The existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable,
          will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve
          consonance.</li>
          <li>
            When dissonance is present, in addition to trying to reduce it, the
            person will actively avoid situations and information which would
            likely increase the dissonance.
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h1>Dissonance in pretty packaging</h1>
          He further explained that, just as hunger motivates us to find food to
          reduce our hunger, cognitive dissonance motivates us to find
          situations to reduce the dissonance. For meat-eating, there are two
          ways to do this: we can change our behaviour or change the belief. We
          can stop eating meat, or come up with reasons why eating meat is
          morally OK.
          </p>
          <p>
          In addition to our own attempts to justify meat-eating, advertising and
          marketing can make it easier for us to do so. According to research by
          sociologist Liz Grauerholz on images of animals in popular culture, one way to
          make meat-eating seem acceptable is to dissociate it from the animal it came
          from. Grauerholz argues that we do this by “transforming animals, which are
          loved, into meats, which are eaten, so that the concepts of ‘animals’ and
          ‘meats’ seem distinct and unrelated”. We call it “veal” instead of baby cow,
          “ham” instead of pig, “game” instead of hunted wild animal. We pack our dead
          animals in pretty packages – physically, verbally and conceptually distancing
          ourselves from the real origin of our food.
        </p>
        <p>
          When looking at commercial depictions of meat, she found that this was
          done in two different ways. The first was showing meat as sanitised,
          plastic-wrapped, chopped into pieces – making it hard to think that it
          came from an animal at all. The second had to do with ‘cutification’ –
          making the animals cuter than they actually are. More than anywhere,
          this is adopted as a strategy in parts of Asia such as Japan. Adverts
          there use what ethologist Konrad Lorenz referred to as the
          Kindchenschema (“baby schema”) – big eyes, petite, round features,
          like we might expect in children’s books. It’s meant to give the
          impression that this meat comes from happy, imaginary animals. Both of
          these serve to distract from the realities of animal cruelty.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t just relevant for meat-eating. When we turn animals or
          humans into objects, and thereby avoid the discomfort caused by
          knowing about the suffering behind consumer goods, we make it easier
          to be cruel. The same processes we see with meat, we see with all
          kinds of other morally unacceptable but common human behaviours that
          have to do with money.
        </p>
        <p>
        We know that poverty causes great suffering, yet instead of sharing our wealth
        we buy another pair of expensive shoes. We fundamentally disagree with the idea
        of child labour or adults working under horrible conditions, but keep shopping
        at discount stores. We stay in the dark, to protect our delicate identities, to
        maintain the illusion that we are consistent and ethically sensible human
        beings.
        </p>
        <p>
      In this constant effort to reduce cognitive dissonance, we may spread morally
      questionable behaviour to others. We begin to shape societies in ways to
      minimise our discomfort, to not remind us of our inconsistencies. We don’t want
      constant reminders. And, as Bastian and Loughnan argue, “through the process of
      dissonance reduction, the apparent immorality of certain behaviours can
      seemingly disappear.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Hypocrisy can flourish in certain social and cultural environments.
          Social habits can cast a veil over our moral conflicts, by normalising
          behaviours and making them invisible and resistant to change.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is time for a revolution in how we talk about human beings, animals and the
        planet, and acknowledge our own hypocrisies. Rather than doing mental gymnastics
        to justify unethical behaviour, we must consider actually changing it.
        Identifying and addressing even just a few of your guilt-ridden ethical
        inconsistencies is likely to make you a happier person, and the planet a better
        place.

        <h1>Extreme Confinement and Abuse</h1>
          <p>
            Pigs, cows, chickens, fish, and other animals raised at factory
            farms experience unimaginable cruelty. MFA investigations have
            uncovered routine abuse and frequent torture at these facilities,
            including cows kicked, punched, and dragged by the neck; piglets’
            tails cut off with dull blades; chickens stabbed and stomped to
            death; and fish skinned and cut open while still conscious and able
            to feel pain. 
          </p>
          <h1>No Compassion for Cows</h1>
          <p>
            Cows exploited for dairy are treated like mere milk-producing
            machines—constantly cycling through pregnancy, birth, and milking
            until their bodies give out or their milk production is no longer
            profitable. Calves used for veal are ripped away from their mothers
            and locked in crates. They are fed a low-iron milk substitute that
            makes them anemic. By the time of slaughter, many calves are too
            weak to walk. 
          </p>
          <p>
            MFA undercover investigations have exposed workers at dairy factory
            farms dragging cows by their necks with ropes attached to tractors
            and viciously kicking and hitting them. Cows were tied up, shocked,
            and hit on their heads with sledgehammers.

            tails cut off with dull blades; chickens stabbed and stomped to
            death; and fish skinned and cut open while still conscious and able
            to feel pain.

          <p>
            Dominion uses drones, hidden and handheld cameras to expose the dark
            underbelly of modern animal agriculture, questioning the morality
            and validity of humankind’s dominion over the animal kingdom. While
            mainly focusing on animals used for food, it also explores other
            ways animals are exploited and abused by humans, including clothing,
            entertainment and research.
